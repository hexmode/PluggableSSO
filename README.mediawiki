== PluggableSSO ==
SSO plugin for PluggableAuth.

This extension works with the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PluggableAuth PluggableAuth] extension to automatically create users for MediaWiki based on Single-Sign-On provisions.

For example, if you have set up Apache and [http://modauthkerb.sourceforge.net/ mod_kerb], you'll be given REMOTE_USER in your HTTP Headers.  In the past, you would the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Auth_remoteuser Auth_remoteuser], extension for this.

This extension is meant to be a drop-in replacement for that.

=== SiteMinder SSO ===

This extension can also replace the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Siteminder_Authentication Siteminder Authentication] extension with a couple of lines of code:

<syntaxhighlight lang="php">
$wgSSOHeader = "SM-MAIL";
$wgAuthRemoteuserDomain = "example.com";
</syntaxhighlight>
